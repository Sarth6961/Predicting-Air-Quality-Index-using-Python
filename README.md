# Predicting-Air-Quality-Index-using-Python
Let us see how to predict the air quality index using Python. AQI is calculated based on chemical pollutant quantity. By using machine learning, we can predict the AQI.

AQI: The air quality index is an index for reporting air quality on a daily basis.  In other words, it is a measure of how air pollution affects oneâ€™s health within a short time period. The AQI is calculated based on the average concentration of a particular pollutant measured over a standard time interval. Generally, the time interval is 24 hours for most pollutants, 8 hours for carbon monoxide and ozone.
